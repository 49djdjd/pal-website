        <h1>What is Pallative Care?</h1>
        <p>Palliative Care is specialized medical care that is aimed at optimizing quality of life by reducing pain, stress, or other symptoms, usually within people with terminal illness. </p>
        <h1>Pallative Care vs. Hospice Care</h1>
        <p> Pallative Care is often compared to Hospice Care; although there are some similarites, there are key differences. Pallative Care provides care for those with serious illnesses but it does not have to be life-threatening. Common examples include cancer, AIDs, or even side effects of treatments. It is important to note that pallative medicine does not replace treatments rather its an addition to provide you with the best quality of life. On the other hand, Hospice Care is for patients who are not expected to recover from their illnesses, it focuses on easing pain/helping prepare for end of life. Pallative Care can be a part of Hospice but it is only a component of Hospice Care. Both of these care section aim at relieveing symptoms as much as possible and a better quality of life rather than treating the illness itself. Lastly, both of these care fall under the section of Comfort Care. </p>
